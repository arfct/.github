Creative Foundation, 2024

Design, Open Source, Software & Tools

Artifact is a non-profit that supports the development of design-focused open source software and tools from a community of creators. It provides hosting, tools, and technical advisory to its contributors and encourages explorations around productivity, entertainment, and digital art through web and mobile platforms.

Works released through Artifact are supported open source contributions and shared infrastructure. The works that have lasting value to the broader world are supported indefinitely, with the community encouraged to connect and participate.
